# IntNeuralODE
This is the respository of my Master Thesis Project tackling the subject of "Continuous Motion Interpolation with Neural Differential Equations"

One can find the thesis report in the folder "report" and the code in the folder "src". There is also a folder call "notebook" where one can find the jupyter notebook used to explore before writing scripts to run the experiments. To better understand the architecture of the code, here is a tree representing the folder structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── data
├── images : contains the images used in the report and more
│   ├── AE : Autoencoder
│   ├── ODE : Ordinary neural differential equation
│   ├── ODE-AE : Ordinary neural differential equation with autoencoder
    ├── VAE : Variational autoencoder

├── notebook : jupyter notebook used to explore the data and the models
│   ├── AE
│   ├── ODE
│   ├── ODE-AE

├── report : contains the report of the project

├── config : 
│   
├── src : contains the code
